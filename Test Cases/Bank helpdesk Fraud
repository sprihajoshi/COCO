Test Case #1: Bank Helpdesk Fraud

Godfrey Norton, aged 76, lives in Dorpstraat 17, Dorpstad 1256AJ. On May 6 2024 around 14:14 she received a call from an anonymous number on his number+31101102103. It was from Irene Adler who claimed to work in the fraud detection department of Bank of Bohemia. She explained that there were series of payments made which seemed fraudulent and thus wanted to confirm if they were real. On checking, Mr. Norton confirms that he made no such payments and could also not see them on his account. Irene inquires if Mr. Norton recently received any communication messages or emails from the Bank. To check this further, she offers to help Mr. Norton to identify the source of a potentially fraudulent message that has put his account in danger of a fraud. For this she requests the download of the software AnyDesk such that she can help him remotely by taking access to his screen. Once done, she asks him to login to the bank such that she can review the missing fraudulent transactions. She then goes through his email to check for any fraudulent messages and claims that a Home food delivery email seemed fake. She then explains that according to the updated policy, it is best if they block the current cards and issue new cards. This way ensures the safety and security of the finances. Mr. Norton agrees. She arranges for a person to pick up the cards, and instructs Mr. Norton to add his cards and his card readers into an envelop and hand it over to the person. To identify the person, she gives a code A101 and the name Watson. 
Around 15:10, a young boy knocks at the door to claiming to be from Bank of Bohemia. As instructed, Mr. Norton asks the boy for his name and the code, which checks out. He then proceeds to give the cards to the boy and asks by when he can get the new one. The boy claims that in 2 weeks he should get them back and otherwise he should contact the Bank again. 
Later that evening, upon checking his account, he realizes there are multiple transactions made. He calls the bank and realizes he has been a victim of fraud. The transactions are as follows: 
Bank Transfer from IBAN1234 to IBAN7890 at 15:28 550EUR.
Cash Withdrawal from ATM1 at 15:22 400EUR. Second Cash Withdrawal from ATM2 at 15:37 550EUR.
