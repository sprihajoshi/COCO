## Test Case #2: Friend-In-Need Fraud

On April 3, 2025, at approximately 11:47 AM, Mr. Joey Tribiani  received a WhatsApp message from an unfamiliar phone number +44 1150 67890, which appeared to be from her close friend, Rachel Green. The message claimed Rachel had recently lost her phone and was using a new number. In the message, Rachel explained that she was in a tight financial situation and urgently needed 2,000EUR to cover an unforeseen medical bill that had to be paid immediately.
The message was convincing, as it included a few personal details that made it seem legitimate, such as the victim's first name and the mention of a medical issue Rachel had faced in the past. Rachelâ€™s also stated that she could not contact her family for the funds and promised to pay Mr. Tribiani back as soon as she could. Rachel also has a strained relationship with her family, so this was understandable. 
Mr. Tribiani, trusting her friend, agreed to transfer the money and was instructed to make a bank transfer to a Barclays account under the name "Mark Willems" and with the account number IBAN2345. He transferred 2,000EUR via online banking at 12:15. 
At 14:30, Mr. Tribiani received a second message from the same number, again claiming to be Rachel. This time, she asked for an additional 1,500EUR for another urgent matter. However, at this point, Mr. Tribiani became suspicious and contacted her friend Rachel through a phone call. It turned out she had never sent messages.
Upon realizing that he had been scammed, Mr. Tribiani immediately contacted his bank and reported the fraudulent transaction.
